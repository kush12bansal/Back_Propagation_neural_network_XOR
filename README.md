# Back_Propagation_neural_network_XOR
In this repository, I am adding my basic matlab code which can be used to train the data set of any XOR data just by changing the data name and ranges. I am adding one input and one output, two inputs and one output, four inputs and one output and four inputs and three outputs with five hidden layers. I am also adding data set which I used. So you can check which data set belongs to which code and check the working of code.
